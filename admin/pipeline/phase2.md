# Phase 2 Status Update On CI/CD Pipeline

For our CI/CD pipelines, we have used automated actions on GitHub as a tool to maintain our code.
We are currently utilizing seven HitHub actions. We have HTML
Validation for validating our front-end pages, ESLint for our JS pages,
Jest for Unit Testing, CSSLint for our CSS styles. We also have JSDocs to generate documentation. 
We hope to automatically deploy those pages to GitHub pages when that is fully implemented. We've
also added Codacy to check and improve our overall code quality.
