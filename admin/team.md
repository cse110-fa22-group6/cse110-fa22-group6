Hi, I'm Andrei Secor, and I'm a third year majoring in Math - Computer Science and Computer Engineering. In the future, I hope to work somewhere in software engineering, though I'm still not sure what exactly I want to do yet, since one of the most important things in a job, for me, is the amount I'm able to learn from it.
