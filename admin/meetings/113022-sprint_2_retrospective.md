### Agenda 
- Sprint Retrospective

### Positive Feedback

- Got lots of work done!! Much better than sprint 1
- Everything went smoothly and got all the goals finished.
- It felt more coherent than sprint 1, I was definitely more clear on what needed to get done
- Good collaboration on finishing up pipeline and fixing issues. Got a lot of little organizing/admin stuff done.
- Better planning, finished everything needed
- I had a better understanding of what I was suppose to do and it seemed to be the same for everyone else

### Negative Feedback 

- Too little work to distribute for some tasks.
- I had a hard time coordinating my task with others (unit tests)
- Ran out of things to do sometimes
- I think communication could still be worked on instead of having to constantly ask whether something was completed

### Things to be improved upon for further Sprints

- Document issues / pull requests better. i sometimes see merges without even getting it approved or creating an issue/pull request in the first place
- Reschedule the sprint check in meeting so that more people could make it.
- More TDD (writing tests before code - it's hard to match tests to code)
- More splitting up/clear delegation of tasks.
- Better organization of pull requests and what definition of done

### Further Thoughts 

- Any other thoughts/comments you had on Sprint 2
