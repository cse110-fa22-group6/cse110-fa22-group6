## Context and Problem Statement

What design do we want to use for our app layout?

What is the best approach for the design aspect of the app?

## Considered Options

* Stick with original wireframe design

* Brainstorm at least one more different layout and compare them before proceeding

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Stick with original wireframe design".

### Consequences
	
  * Already have a layout and can immediately start work on frontend dev

  * Straightfoward, readable layout

  * Might miss out on better options

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Keeping Original Wireframe Design

Wireframe for layout: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPJmhRIk=/
  
* Good, we all agreed on and like the layout
  
* Good, inspired by already used and liked apps
  
* Good, simple layout, with all info visible on one page

* Good, more time efficient - we can tweak as we go, rather than come up with a whole seperate plan first
  
* Bad, didn't come up with multiple options to be able to compare directly

### Brainstorming Other Layout Designs

* Good, can directly compare different design options

* Good, can make sure we chose the best layout that we all agree on

* Bad, will take more time to create and compare them, will delay development
